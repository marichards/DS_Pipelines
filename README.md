# Data Science Pipelines (in Python)

This repository contains a collection of notebooks with examples of various data science tasks, comprising my personal DS pipeline. Each notebook is dedicated to a particular facet of data science, uses built-in data sets, and contains many snippets of code to be reused later in real analyses.

## Seaborn

For general EDA plotting, I prefer to use the Seaborn library. This notebook contains a wide variety of different plots that come in handy for exploring and visualizing data sets

## Cleaning

Various examples for cleaning data, including but not limited to:

* Dealing with missing values
* Replacing or renaming data
* Transforming data
* Re-sampling

## Regression

Workflows for performing regression, from simple linear regression to more complex tools like random forests and gradient boosting.

## Classification

Workflows for performing classification, with all sorts of possible algorithms. In addition to models themselves, this includes evaluation tools, like ROC curves and heat maps. 

## Unsupervised Learning

Workflows for different types of unsupervised learning, namely clustering and dimensional reduction.
